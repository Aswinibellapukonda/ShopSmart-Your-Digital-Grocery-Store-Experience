The Digital Grocery Store Experience is a full-stack web application designed to offer a 
seamless online shopping experience for grocery items. Users can browse products, add 
them to a shopping cart, and place orders. The application also supports user 
authentication, order history, and an admin panel to manage orders and products. The 
project aims to simulate a real-world e-commerce workflow tailored to grocery needs.
